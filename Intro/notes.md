Fundamentally, an algorithm is a repeatable set of steps to solve a given instance of a certain type of problem. Our top 3 concerns when devising an algorithm are:

# Correctness

# Efficiency

# Ease of Implementation

These three concerns are often in tension. The desire to have all three of the above often lead us toward adopting _heuristics_, which appear to work but in fact give incorrect results with certain input sets. For this reason, it is important to think carefully about edge cases that can break a reasonable-looking algorithm, and think carefully about correctness.
